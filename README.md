#LogAI



**LogAI**, is an automated log analysis and visualiation scheme, which predicts the state of large scale QE testing spanning across multiple components. Designed to enable large scale enterprise log analysis automated, which currently takes multiple hours of wasted/duplicated effort across teams. The problem is further exacerbated, when there are multiple inter-dependent components and multiple releases in progress at the same time. Different teams typically go back and look at what has happened in the recent or distant past, with their own recency criteria. All of this can be automated with the eventual goal of creating defect tickets in the tracking systems. 

Core feature:
   * Error grouping and correlation
   * Run Profiling and recency record
   * Failure Modeling compared to run-profile
   * Built-in visualization, exposed via - LogSearch/Zeppelin
